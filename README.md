# token-examples

This repository provides educational examples of how to interact with **ERC20** and **ERC721** smart contracts using **Ethers.js**. The scripts include:
- Deploying ERC20 & ERC721 contracts
- Transferring ERC20 tokens
- Approving ERC20 token transfers and executing `transferFrom`
- Querying blockchain events (`Transfer`, `Approval`)
- Interacting with ERC721 NFTs

These scripts are designed for **local blockchain environments**.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/zsystm/token-examples.git
cd token-examples
npm install
```

### üìå Configuration 
1. Set up a local Ethereum JSON-RPC node (e.g., kurtosis)
2. Update your .env file with private keys:
```
ETH_RPC_URL="http://localhost:59997"
SENDER_PRIVATE_KEY="0xbcdf20249abf0ed6d944c0288fad489e33f66b3960d9e6229c1cd214ed3bbe31"
RECIPIENT_PRIVATE_KEY="39725efee3fb28614de3bacaffe4cc4bd8c436257e2c8bb887c4b5c4be45e76d"
```
